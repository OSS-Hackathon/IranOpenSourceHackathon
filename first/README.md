_Iran Open Source Hackathon_ is an open-source hackathon (duh) with the aim of encouraging participation in open-source contribution amongst Iranian developers.
There is a [curated list of repositories][REPOS] whose maintainers volunteered to be part of the hackathon. Contribute to any of these repositories [during the hackathon][DURATION], and at the end [top contributors will be acknowledged here][TOP-CONTS] (so yes in the end its just about bragging rights).

👉 If you are a maintainer and want to enter some of your repositories in the hackathon so our participants will contribute to them, check [this section][MAINTS].

## How Can I Participate?

Contribute to one of [these repositories][REPOS] during the [time of the hackathon][DURATION]:

- Make a pull request, include #iosh⚠️ in its title⚠️.
- The pull request **MUST** be accepted to the repository before [the end of the hackathon][DURATION].
- Each pull request will count towards your total score (depends on how many lines of code it is ⚠️).
- At the end, top 5⚠️ contributors (highest scores ⚠️) will be acknowledged [here][TOP-CONTS]. We might update the list during the hackathon as well.

👉 If you are unfamiliar with open-source contribution, git or github, take a look at [these resources][TUTS].

**NOTE**: Please carefully read our [code of conduct][COC] before you start contributing.

<br>

### Why Should I Participate?

- You will help improve software that people like you use (apes together strong).
- You will learn a lot (like seriously, a TON).
- You will earn street-cred (which also helps with employability).

## I Am A Maintainer. Can I Add My Repos To This Hackathon?

Of course! You need to:

1. Fork this repository.
2. For each repository like `https://github.com/jafar/my-repo`, add a [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file to `first/repos` \
  (i.e. `first/repos/jafar/my-repo.yaml`):
  ```yaml
  # first/repos/jafar/my-repo.yaml
  
  name: My Cool Repository
  description: I am particularly cool here
  languages:
    - JavaScript
    - Hashemi
    - ...
  ```
3. Make a pull request.

👉 You can see examples in the [repos](/first/repos) directory.

👉 You can add a list of maintainers (with whom hackathon participants can be in contact) as well:
```yaml
# first/repos/jafar/my-repo.yaml

name: My Cool Repository
description: I am particularly cool here
languages:
  - JavaScript
  - Hashemi
#
# 👉 for user `https://github.com/asghar`, add `asghar` to this list
# 👉 also don't forget the repo owner if they are going to be a maintainer as well
#
maintainers:
  - jafar
  - asghar
  - nooshin
  - maliheh
```

👉 If your repo belongs to a company or organization, you **MUST** specify maintainers independently.

**NOTE**: Please carefully read our [code of conduct][COC] before you submit your repositories.
