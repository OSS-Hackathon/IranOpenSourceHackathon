_Iran Open Source Hackathon_ is an open-source hackathon (duh) with the aim of encouraging participation in open-source contribution amongst Iranian developers.
There is a [curated list of repositories][REPOS] whose maintainers volunteered to be part of the hackathon. Contribute to any of these repositories [during the hackathon][DURATION], and at the end [top contributors will be acknowledged here][TOP-CONTS] (so yes in the end its just about bragging rights).

In this readme and in [the code of conduct][COC], keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when appearing in caps lock and in bold, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119). This is not a software spec document, but still the extra clarity helps avoiding confusion.

## How Can I Participate?

Contribute to one of [these repositories][REPOS] during the [time of the hackathon][DURATION]:

- Make a pull request, include #iosh⚠️ in its title⚠️.
- The pull request **MUST** be accepted to the repository before [the end of the hackathon][DURATION].
- Each pull request will count towards your total score (depends on how many lines of code it is ⚠️).
- At the end, top 5⚠️ contributors (highest scores ⚠️) will be acknowledged [here][TOP-CONTS]. We might update the list during the hackathon as well.

Also be carefully read our [code of conduct][COC] before you start contributing. Administrative action (including bans from current hackathon
or even from all subsequent hackathons) might be taken in response to violations of the [code of conduct][COC].
