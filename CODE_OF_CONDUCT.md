# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines acceptable, encouraged, and unacceptable behavior for organizers, participants, and repository maintainers
participating in [Iran Open Source Hackathon](https://github.com/OSS-Hackathon/IranOpenSourceHackathon) events. Within this document:

- **Organizers** denotes maintainers of this project and other people involved in decision making for these events.
- **Participants** denotes people who contribute to repositories specified for each event.
- **Repository Maintainers** denotes maintainers of repositories specific for each event to which participants should contribute.

## Goals & Values

The aim of these events is to (in order of priority):

1. Encourage Iranian developers to further participate in open-source, mainly through contribution to other projects.
2. Provide a spotlight for Iranian open-source projects and help them build a community.

We strive to make these events inclusive and welcoming to everyone, and provide a harassment-free and positive
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual identity, age, ethnicity, disability, 
experience, etc.

Note that these events are focused on Iranian open source community. If you are not Iranian, you are still more than welcome to 
participate and/or enter repositories in the hackathon. While we greatly appreciate either (or any other form of contribution),
we might be unable to provide a spotlight for your contributions.

## Encouraged Behavior

Generally speaking, any action or interaction that strives towards aforementioned goals and values
is appreciated and encouraged.

### Examples

- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Remember the human. Criticise ideas and opinions, not people.
- Understand and work with different perspectives and viewpoints.
- View criticism as a positive, not a negative.
- Be empathetic towards other community members.

### For Participants

- First and foremost, focus on improving the projecs you contribute to.
- Read provided documents for each repository you want to contribute to. Specifically, follow their code of conduct.
- Check the issues and pull requests before submitting.
- When in-doubt, create issues beforehand to discuss your solution with repository maintainers.
- Understand the project goals, structure, conventions, code styles, testing, etc. Follow contribution guidelines if provided.
- Actively seek advice from repository maintainers, and respect their opinion, experience and time.

### For Repository Maintainers

- Be friendly, welcoming and empathetic to new contributors. Properly explain to them why they are wrong when they are.
- Try to respond to issues and pull requests within 48 hours, if possible.
- Try to prepare _good first issues_ for new contributors to work on. Generally listing issues that people can help with would be much encouraged.
- Provide documentation for project goals, structure, conventions, code styles, dev setup, etc. Having a [contributing guideline](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) is encouraged.
- Provide community guidelines. Having a [code of conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/) is much encouraged. Ensure that your code of conduct or community guidelines follow the same values of inclusivity and welcomingness.
- Be transparent with your processes, what are project priorities, why decisions are made, etc.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Similarly, any action or interaction detrimental to aforementioned goals and values
is unacceptable, and appropriate and fair corrective action will be taken in response.

### Examples

- Avoid use of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Avoid trolling/insulting/derogatory language. Avoid remarks that can constitute as personal attacks.
- Avoid behavior that can constitute as public or private harassment (whether in the forums related to these events or in other spaces).
- Avoid publishing others' personal information (name, email, address, phone number, etc.) without their explicit permission.
- Avoid any conduct that is unacceptable in a professional setting.

### For Participants

- Avoid spamming repositories. You should be helping improve open-source projects, not use them to gain scores.
- Avoid disruptive contributions, i.e. taking someone else's pull request / branch / work and submiting it.
- Avoid automated pull requests (automated typo fixes, whitespace removal, image optimization).
- Avoid focusing on issues that are not a priority for the project. Be helpful, not a hindrance.

### For Repository Maintainers

- Avoid being elitist, harsh, discouraging, or any other attitude that goes against inclusivity, towards participants.
- Avoid marking contributions to your own repositories for participation in the hackathon.
- Avoid information disparity, favoritsm towards certain individuals / groups, stalling, or any action that is clearly with
the intent of providing unfair competitive advantage.

and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing 
the project or its community. It similarly applies to all project and public spaces for all participating repositories, when individuals are representing any of the participating projects, at least for the duration of their participation. In severe
cases of violation, the scope might be extended to activity of previously participating repositories as well.

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
